# WireGuard Config Generator
## [https://longqt-sea.github.io/wg-generator](https://longqt-sea.github.io/wg-generator/)

## Usage
1. For most users, youâ€™ll likely only need to specify the server address and adjust the number of clients.
2. Press Generate configs and review the output.
3. Replace the configuration in the script [wireguard_install.sh](https://github.com/LongQT-sea/wg-generator/blob/main/wireguard_install.sh) with the one you generated and run the script to install.

## Key Features
Generates WireGuard configuration files for Ubuntu and Debian servers and multiple clients.
Includes support for port forwarding rules.
All key generation is performed client-side, locally, using the wireguard.js file from the official [wireguard-tools](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/tree/contrib/keygen-html/wireguard.js) repository.

## Security Warning
For secure and production-ready WireGuard deployments:
- Always generate keys securely using the official wg command-line tool on a trusted machine.
- Use this tool only as a template generator to simplify the creation of WireGuard configuration files.
